# Shop Explorer

Small React + TypeScript app that uses the Platzi / Fake Store API to browse products, view details and manage a small cart.

Setup

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

What I implemented

- Vite + React + TypeScript scaffold
- Product list with search and category filter
- Product detail page with optimistic "Add to cart"
- Cart page with quantity increment/decrement, remove, and localStorage persistence
- TanStack Query for data fetching

Notes

- This is a minimal implementation focused on clarity. Tests and more robust error handling can be added as next steps.
